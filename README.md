To run : python3 run_game.py

You are an intergalactic carpet fitter on a mission to fit out the 
Universe 'one room' and one carpet tile at a time! Of course,
complications such as monsters arise :-) As you are in interior design
and not the marines, your only option is to avoid them.

Use WASD to move around or D-pad on a gamepad.
